## Workflow Example: User Perspective

### Scenario: Deploy a Web Application

1. **User uploads architecture image** (screenshot from draw.io or manual diagram)
   ```
   User uploads: my_architecture.png
   ```

2. **System analyzes the image**
   ```
   Vision API extracts: VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, ALB
   Returns: Architecture JSON
   ```

3. **System generates Terraform**
   ```
   Generates: Complete main.tf with all resources
   Includes: Variables, outputs, best practices
   ```

4. **User reviews and deploys**
   ```
   Runs: terraform plan (user reviews)
   Runs: terraform apply (user confirms)
   ```

5. **Infrastructure is live**
   ```
   EC2 instance running
   RDS database created
   S3 bucket initialized
   Security groups configured
   ```

## Security Notes

🔒 **No Credentials in Diagrams** - Use AWS IAM for all auth

🔒 **Image Processing** - Uploaded images deleted immediately after processing

🔒 **Temporary Files** - All temporary files cleaned up automatically

🔒 **Logging** - All operations logged for audit trail

🔒 **No Hardcoded Secrets** - Uses existing credential management

## Troubleshooting

### Vision Analysis Fails
- Image must be clear and readable
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP
- Try uploading a higher resolution image

### Terraform Generation Issues
- Verify Mermaid syntax is correct
- Ensure all resources are recognized
- Check resource names are descriptive

### Deployment Failures
- Verify AWS credentials are configured
- Check IAM permissions for required services
- Review terraform plan carefully

### Service Not Found
- Check AWS region is correct
- Verify resource type is in supported list
- Use descriptive resource names

## Integration with Existing Features

This feature integrates seamlessly with:
- ✅ Existing LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
- ✅ Credential management (keyring, Azure KeyVault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- ✅ Terraform workspace system
- ✅ MCP tool framework
- ✅ AGUI REST API architecture

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Mermaid parsing
python examples_architecture_deployment.py

# Test image parsing (requires LLM credentials)
curl -F "file=@architecture.png" http://localhost:9595/api/architecture/parse-image

# Test full deployment workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:9595/api/architecture/deploy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"architecture": {...}}'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate into UI** - Use `ui/architecture-deployment.js` in your frontend
2. **Test with your architecture** - Upload diagrams and images
3. **Customize for your use case** - Extend ArchitectureParser for specific needs
4. **Deploy to production** - Use MCP tools with agents
5. **Monitor deployments** - Check logs and Terraform state

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DRIVEN_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
3. Check server logs: `logs/agui_server.log`
4. Review examples in `examples_architecture_deployment.py`

**Everything is ready to use!** Start the AGUI server and try uploading your first architecture diagram.
